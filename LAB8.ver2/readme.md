Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the entire list is sorted. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.

On the other hand, Quick Sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm with an average-case time complexity of O(n log n). It uses a divide-and-conquer approach by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the list into two sublists based on the pivot, and recursively sorting the sublists. Quick Sort has better performance for larger lists but can be more complex to implement correctly.
