My name is XX with matric number XX. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because I want to work hard for my programming language.
I acquired X for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can managed to get A for this DS subject in this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will practise to improve my programming skill everyday. Wish me luck!!
