In a class called MinMaxTwoDArray, write two generic methods:
a. First method returns the minimum element in a two-dimensional
array. Below is the method signature:
public static <E extends Comparable<E>> E min(E[][] list)
b. Second method returns the maximum element in a two-dimensional
array. Below is the method signature:
public static <E extends Comparable<E>> E max(E[][] list)
c. Create a test program that creates one instance of generic class of
type Integer called numbers with the elements: {4, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 3}.
Display the minimum and maximum elements using the min and
max methods.
