Each node in a doubly linked list contains three fields:

A value field, which stores the data for that node.
A pointer to the previous node in the list.
A pointer to the next node in the list.

Node<E> tmp = new Node(element, null, tail), 
null represents the value of the prev parameter of the Node constructor.

new Node(element, null, tail)
