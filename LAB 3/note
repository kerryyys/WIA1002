UML diagram的目的？
The purpose of using UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram is to provide a visual representation of the system being developed. 
It is a standardized graphical language used in software engineering to model, design, and document software systems. 
UML diagrams allow software developers to visualize the architecture, design, and behavior of a software system.

UML diagrams are used to communicate with stakeholders, such as developers, testers, and project managers. 
They provide a clear understanding of the system's components, their relationships, and their behaviors. 
This helps to identify potential design issues and make design decisions more efficiently. 
UML diagrams also help in the documentation process of the software system, making it easier for new developers to understand and maintain the system. 
Overall, UML diagrams are an essential tool in software engineering to model and design complex software systems.
